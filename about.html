                <h2 class="p-4">Family business:</h2>
                <p class="p-1">In the heart of London for 50 years! But thats not where it started. Our founders Micheal and Brenda Regan come from families who owned furniture factories that would later on become Focus Furnishings 1st suppliers. 
                    Having grown up around furniture and spending their early working years in the manufactoring side of the trade, our founders quickly learnt the meaning of good quality furniture. With this, craftsmanship and quality became the foundation of our shop.
                    50 Years later Focus Furnishings is standing and our local competition has faded.</p>
