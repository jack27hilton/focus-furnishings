# Focus-Furnishings
### Small website for a family run furniture retailer, who dont have much online presence.

## Purpose:
The main purpose of this website is to display the products available at Focus Furnishnigs online to make it easier for customers and to advertise the quality of products to potential customers. Also the shop needs an online presence.
This is important for the shop as they have gained a reputation for being oldschool being one of the only independent furniture retailers left in the area and using old methods such as sales/reciepts on paper invoices and only taking payments in store.
Hopefully with this website customers will see that even though they are an oldschool shop, they have all the new school products and worth shopping with.
On top of this, given their small online presence and the fact there is other furnitre retailers in the area one of which shares the name "Focus", this website will ensure customers can find the right information for this shop which is obviously very important.

## Design:
### Page 1 (home page):
![image of website home page](screenshots/home-ss.png)
The home page's purpose is to be a nice and easy place for a user to land. At the top they will find the nav bar that will quickly take them to the browse section if they want to look at potential buys or the about if they want to read up on the company. On a desktop or similar sized screen they will alos have the shops phone number and adress/loaction near the nav bar at the top of the main section of the page so people see it instantly and they know where it is if they need it. The social links are in the footer as it looks professional and alot of website have that type of information at the bottom so its common practice for people to navigate down the page to find and therefore makes it easier. The 1st thing that probably catches the eyes of anyone who lands on the page is the "home video" of a person opening the bifolding doors on a german wardrobe. This is important as it sets a tone of quality straight away and it is inviting people to look further into the shops products while making the shop feel honest.

Designing the style of the webisite was challenging as alot of the bigger furniture retailers website contain moving imagery of their products as their main design which has become a very popular and is almost expectced from customers now.
However i could not implement this into this website as i could not use javascript or other tools to create this effect.
So I opted for a very unique but still simple design that keeps it easy for a customer to navigate and find information but the subtle lines and colour schemes create a sleek feel to it.

## Tools:
